## Purpose

Dialogue narration allocation rules: Allocate dialogue, narration, action explanation, and duration to the current storyboard row only when supported by text, fact, character intent, or scene purpose.

## Source Basis

This entry was created from a confirmed manual intake package. Audit candidates were used only as summary evidence. Runtime output must not include audit images, audit text, hidden prompt templates, local-only identifiers, audit registries, or unpublished KB detail.

## Applies To

- create_story_task
- generate_storyboard
- repair_storyboard
- validate_result

## Claims Summary

- Bind each dialogue or narration line to the current row's person, action, scene purpose, and duration.
- Use visible action or silence when dialogue evidence is weak.
- Keep narration short and row-bound when it clarifies information that cannot be shown visibly.

## Runtime Mapping

- validation_rule_packs: vg-dialogue-narration-allocation-rules
- selected_kb_rules: rule:dialogue-narration-allocation-rules

## PWA Fields Served

## Negative Constraints
