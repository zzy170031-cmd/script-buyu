## Purpose

Scene spatial prop continuity anchor: Keep location, left-right relation, eyeline, prop anchors, background anchors, and event order continuous across adjacent storyboard rows.

## Source Basis

This entry was created from a confirmed manual intake package. Audit candidates were used only as summary evidence. Runtime output must not include audit images, audit text, hidden prompt templates, local-only identifiers, audit registries, or unpublished KB detail.

## Applies To

- create_story_task
- generate_storyboard
- repair_storyboard
- validate_result

## Claims Summary

- Preserve character position, eyeline direction, prop state, background anchor, and event order when splitting rows.
- Use camera movement and shot size to clarify spatial relation instead of resetting location or screen direction.
- Treat a prop handoff, position change, or event-order change as a row-level continuity requirement.

## Negative Constraints

- Do not hide spatial continuity repair in final prompt_text as an internal note.
- Do not create new props or locations to solve a continuity gap.
